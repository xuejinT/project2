        <h3>625-705</h3>
        <p>The practice is known to have existed in the Tang Dynasty, when Empress Wu Zetian sent a pair of pandas to the Japanese emperor.

        <h3>December, 1936</h3>
        <p>
            The first living panda to go to the West was Su Lin. Ruth Harkness, an American fashion designer, registered the 3-month-pld baby panda as a puppy when boarding her ship back to America.

        <h3>1941</h3>
        <p>
            Song May-Ling (Madame Chiang Kai-shek) gave a pair of pandas to America in appreciation of their help to China. It was the first time China delivered a live panda in the government’s name. Chiang’s government presented 14 pandas to various western countries.

        <h3>1946</h3>
        <p>
            Panda ‘Lien Ho’ and a Chinese biologist arrived in London to rapturous enthusiasm. Realizing the diplomatic goodwill value of pandas, they have since mostly turned up in the west as political gifts.

        <h3>1949</h3>
        <p>
            After Mao Zedong declared the creation of the People’s Republic of China, the giant panda was gifted exclusively to allied socialist states. Appreciating how scarce wild giant pandas had become, poaching was strictly prohibited.

        <h3>State Gift (From 1950s)</h3>
        <p>
            The Panda’s diplomatic career formally took off in the 1950s. Twenty-three giant pandas were sent abroad as state gifts to nice countries, while an additional panda was exchanged for three giraffes, two rhinos, two hippos and two zebras with an Austrian animal dealer.
        </p>
        <p>Five of the 23 panda ambassadors are still alive, including one in Japan, three in Mexico and one in Germany. These countries have ownership of the offspring.

        <h3>Cooperative research (1990 to now)</h3>
        <p>
            From 1990, the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA) and China Zoological Association, reached an agreement with the International Wildlife Conservation Agency to Loan giant pandas for cooperative research. Pandas now go abroad for fees, which vary according to the receiving country.
